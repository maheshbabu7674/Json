JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used to transmit data between a server and a client, especially in web applications, or for storing configuration settings and data structures.
a). Json is syntax for storing and exchange data.
b). Basically designed for uman-readable data interchange.
c). Json is text, written with java script object notation.

Key Features of JSON:

1.Key-Value Pairs: JSON represents data in key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, or null.

Example:

{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "isStudent": false
}


2.Data Types: JSON supports several data types:

String: "Hello World"
Number: 25
Boolean: true or false
Array: A list of values in square brackets []
Object: A collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}
Null: Represents an empty value
Data should be separated by commas

3.Arrays: JSON allows you to group multiple values in an array.

Example:

{
    "names": ["John", "Jane", "Doe"]
}

Nested Arrays:

{
  "department": "IT",
  "employees": [
    {
      "name": "Alice",
      "id": 1,
      "skills": ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Bob",
      "id": 2,
      "skills": ["Python", "Django", "Flask"]
    }
  ],
  "projects": [
    {
      "projectName": "Website Redesign",
      "team": [
        {
          "memberName": "Alice",
          "role": "Lead Developer"
        },
        {
          "memberName": "Bob",
          "role": "Backend Developer"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "projectName": "API Development",
      "team": [
        {
          "memberName": "Bob",
          "role": "Lead Developer"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}



4. Nested Objects: JSON objects can be nested, meaning an object can contain another object or an array.

Example:

{
    "person": {
        "name": "John",
        "address": {
            "city": "New York",
            "zip": "10001"
        }
    }
}
