JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used to transmit data between a server and a client, especially in web applications, or for storing configuration settings and data structures.

### Key Features of JSON:
1. **Key-Value Pairs**: JSON represents data in key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, or `null`.

   Example:
   ```json
   {
       "name": "John",
       "age": 30,
       "isStudent": false
   }
   ```

2. **Data Types**: JSON supports several data types:
   - **String**: `"Hello World"`
   - **Number**: `25`
   - **Boolean**: `true` or `false`
   - **Array**: A list of values in square brackets `[]`
   - **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`
   - **Null**: Represents an empty value

3. **Arrays**: JSON allows you to group multiple values in an array.

   Example:
   ```json
   {
       "names": ["John", "Jane", "Doe"]
   }
   ```

4. **Nested Objects**: JSON objects can be nested, meaning an object can contain another object or an array.

   Example:
   ```json
   {
       "person": {
           "name": "John",
           "address": {
               "city": "New York",
               "zip": "10001"
           }
       }
   }
   ```

### Common Use Cases:
- **APIs**: JSON is widely used in REST APIs to exchange data between clients and servers.
- **Configurations**: Many applications use JSON to store configuration settings.
- **Data Storage**: JSON is used for storing simple structured data.

It's commonly used in web development and is language-agnostic, meaning it can be parsed and generated in most programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and more.
